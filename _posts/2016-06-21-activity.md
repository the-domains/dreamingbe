## The entire Universe is this fantastic Activity, too wonderfully diverse to be called 'singular,' too interconnected to be called 'multiple.' 

I use the word "Activity" in several related ways. Most importantly, I use it to refer to _anything and everything that happens_. You picking your nose is 'activity,' so is the nuclear fusion of the sun. A thought is an activity. The entire Universe is this fantastic Activity, too wonderfully diverse to be called 'singular,' too interconnected to be called 'multiple.'   
Every moment pulses, every moment Change. Every moment, the Unmanifest and Unconditioned Creative Reality meets the Manifest Reality, and every moment all is new: every moment new and fresh. A creative stream that has no beginning and no end.   
And you are that stream.  
  
You will never be conscious of the process of the cells of your lungs in the same way you can be aware of a thought. You will never be 'conscious' of the movement of the mountains in the way you can become conscious of the beating of your heart.  
  
We tend to divide up our awareness into 'conscious' and 'unconscious.' I'm suggesting that it's a fruitful experiment, at the least, to imagine---or recognize--- that what you are, underneath all of this, is the sum total of everything that is conscious and unconscious. Most of us are aware that there's more to our minds than what we're consciously aware of---drives and motivations we are aghast of, and need to consciously bring to light. I'm suggesting that this boundary is entirely arbitrary, and that when we recognize that, we can simply relax into the sum total of all conscious and unconscious Activity. Not all of it will be relevant to our individual lives, of course---you don't need to _know_ everything, and that's very much the point. When you look closely at thought, or more simply at the beating of your heart: the processes that your Identity does emerge out of you have little direct control over anyway.  
  
There's very little that you really need to _know_, in the sense we tend to use that word. The vast, vast majority of what makes us who we are is 'under the water' - we are the tip of the iceberg, but we are also what's under the surface, and we are the vastness of the ocean as well.  
  
We don't have to and simply can't make all of that vastness 'conscious.' We just have to recognize it, recognize that it's actually _always_ been this way whether we've been aware of it or not, and relax into that: the Wholeness of Process.  
  
We make a mistake when we believe that what isn't conscious in this narrowly defined way isn't active---it's the mistake of the Deists, of the 'clock-maker God.'  
  
Activity is not control. In Dreaming, the sense of active control becomes less and less---or more and more narrow. What you _can_ do becomes clearer, what is possible for you to be and do in each moment becomes clearer--- even if that Activity is merely continually bringing your focus to listening to the field, as they say.
