# Intrapersonal Dreaming

## Like Indra's net, any node of Dreaming is reflected in any other node of Dreaming, at any scale. All is contained in all.

Your Root-Pattern reflects and is reflected in any element of your identity. That is, any internal dynamics will reflect this Pattern, and be reflected in it. Whether we think of this in terms of Chakras with particular frequencies of energy, or as psycho-dynamics within ourselves and between different ways of answering the question "who am I," (how you show up with your parents, with your children, with your spouse, at work, with your friends, etc.)---or in the various organs, systems, and functions of your body--- any way that you hold your self as being composed of interconnected centers. We can differentiate between these different patterns, but we can never fully separate them: they are reflected one in the other.  
  
One example of what I mean: many people I come into contact with are extremely bright. Over time, they have learned to orient to the world primarily through mental and psychic objects. As a habitual flow of energy, any energy that comes in heads up to their minds. But this is far from merely a pattern of the head: it reflects a whole-bodied Pattern, and will have an effect on the energy and manifestation of their Body, and of their Heart as well. To over-emphasize the mind, we under-emphasize the body. We may have 'healthy' ways of compensating for this, such as exercising, or unhealthy ways, smoking, or eating heavy meals that cause you to become sluggish. Or we may become sick at regular intervals. The point is, each in their way brings attention to the body---though still in a mental way. None of these are truly "Grounding" activities---they relate 'to' the body rather than 'as' the body. But they serve a purpose, and are reflected in the habitual way of orienting to the world through mental energy---itself reflective of Dreaming Humanity, your culture, and Dreaming Earth.   
You will find these patterns of Dreaming outside of you as well---in the things you find easy and difficult, in the people you are attracted to and find less attractive, in the way you keep your home and what you do for a living. Like Indra's net, any node of Dreaming is reflected in any other node of Dreaming, at any scale. All is contained in all.
