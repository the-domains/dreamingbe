# Dreaming, Emanation, and the Self

From the View of Dreaming, we see that whatever it is that is bringing the world about moment to moment to moment is you. The world that we are in contact with, what I call Manifest Reality, is the manifestation, or projection, of unconditional creativity, and that is you.   
I use the word 'emanation' for this, and Dreaming includes practices to help people's identities drop into this much more encompassing process.   
What I do not mean is that the world is a product of your Identity, or your Ego---rather, that your Ego is something arising out of your Dreaming. The world is not merely a projection of your ego self, or your bodily sense of self. In Dreaming, we're relaxing Identity into the activity of the world around us. We have a much more direct connection to this than we realize. It does not feel like identity, because we're so used to wedding identity with ego.   
We may object: I am not _conscious_ of what you're talking about, and this is precisely the point. We are not attempting to bring our waking sense of consciousness to unconscious material, though that is a natural by-product of Dreaming. We are rather relaxing our sense of identity, presence, and experience to include both what is conscious, and what is un-conscious--- an 'un-consciousness' that can include bodily processes, shadow---i.e. senses of self and identity that are actively dis-identified with--- as well as larger 'un-consciousnesses': _other_ people's waking consciousness, subtle "dream-land" experiences, processing that happens before we're aware of it, and the Great Un-Consciousness: the process of Creativity itself, manifesting moment to moment as the world we are.  
  
In locating the world as being outside of us, in, say, walking down a hallway and perceiving an objective wall, an objective door with which I can interact with, we cut ourselves off from the activity of the world. This is the Mental mode of human being, which is mediated by the ego. To read this and imagine that this indicates that this ego is actively projecting the world around it, that the wall and door are emanating from this 'small-self,' is to make a corresponding mistake. In relaxing Identity below this line of un/consciousness, we recognize rather that this sense of self, this ego, is an aspect of the same activity that is bringing the walls and door into being.   
The ego, like everything, is neither real nor unreal. It is _empty_. One, Zero, and Multiple. It is an activity along the rest of the activities of the world.
