# What is Creativity? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9a3601b1-dd01-4755-beb8-9bb8245140e5.jpg)

## Life as lived is constantly fresh.

Whitehead thought three things were necessary metaphysically: something, nothing, and Creativity. 

I say these as Zero-ness, One-ness, and Multiplicity, or Infinitude, or Creativity.   
The boundaries between them underly all of our concepts about life, including major constructs such as self and other. 

And yet while these appear to be three things, three separate categories with which to define our experiences, they're really reducible to one another. (Try and imagine One-ness with nothing (not even you) to define itself against... quite a bit like a void of nothing, no? Infinitely stretching in any conceivable dimension?) 

This One, Empty 'thing' that appears in an infinite Multiplicity of ways is unnamable, though there are many names for it. For the purposes of Dreaming, I refer to it most often as Creativity. 

Life as lived is constantly fresh. Every moment is new, physiologically, phenomenologically, and in reality. With meditation, you can perceive this freshness, and it can become a permanent aspect of your experience. It's possible not only to be passively aware of this, but to actively lean into it. 

I use the term "Unconditional Creativity." Every moment is new, and includes the moment previous. We are conditioned by what has been, it is how we find ourselves here. And, we have an unlimited and mostly unacknowledged power from this place. Creativity is this constant newness, this constant freshness.
