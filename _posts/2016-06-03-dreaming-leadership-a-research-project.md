After a conversation yesterday with Michael Schwartz, which included discussions about what I have recently been calling Dreaming, We Space, and post-AQAL Integral Theory, I've decided to undertake a research program in Dreaming Leadership. This is a first general explanation of several threads and ideas that I would like to explore, along with a general methodology. As an initial step, much of the below may and will change in detail, though it will likely not change in impulse.

I've been Dreaming now for about a month with other people, entering a state of Open Creativity I'll describe more fully elsewhere. I use this state along with the View of Dreaming (also described elsewhere) to invite people into this state as a means of exploring issues in their lives.

Each session has been radically different, both in terms of content and experience: intersubjective experience, as well as individual experience for both participants.

The work of Dreaming extends from my work with We Space in research that culminated in my thesis: "I, We, All: Intersubjectivity, and Human Becoming (check)" written as my final project for a Master's Degree in Integral Theory.

My initial sense of the shape the research will be taking starts from the project of the thesis: 1st person explorations, in both writing and recording my own experience of and while Dreaming, to help elucidate what Dreaming is; 1st person examinations of my own 'structures of consciousness,' 2nd-person interviews with people I see contributing to the field of "Dreaming Leadership" and Dreaming Organizations, a website (or a sub-section of my larger website Dreaming.be) dedicated to Dreaming Leadership, for the purposes of eliciting community reactions and collaboration, in addition to publicizing interviews and literature review, and 3rd person literature reviews and structural analyses.

My motivation for this is largely to advance possibilities glimpsed first during my Master's Thesis. Among other things (which I will perhaps mention later), I'm calling the practice of Dreaming "Dreaming," because in advanced states of We Space, the experience feels 'dream-like.' More than this, I began to use the term "Collective Lucid Dreaming." There is a noetic sense in these practices that We, sitting here in this room, are shaping the world that we are in a much more direct way than we usually perceive. Collective: We perceive a 'shared' element of consciousness and awareness that we tend not to emphasize in our current culture. Not merely "one mind," we are also not as separate as we believe, and this awareness can become self-reflexively aware. Much of my thesis emerged out of my chasing this possibility. Lucid: this intersubjective awareness can become self-reflexively aware through and as the participants, and is experienced with a sense of lucidity and awakeness, akin but not reducible to a non-dual awakeness in an individual. Dreaming: see above and below and left and right ;).  
Additionally, this appears to me to be genuinely Emergent (and was confirmed in the discussion yesterday with Michael Schwartz)--- that is, there is no 'center' of this work: it is arising simultaneously in many different individuals and quarters of the world.

In the past few months, it is as if I've only started taking the 'Dreaming' element in "Collective Lucid Dreaming" seriously. I have intuited this as a possibility for several years, however, not only for a group, but also for individuals. We are on the cusp of a way-of-being that is, in Gebserian terms, genuinely "Integral." As we process the culmination of the Mental age, possibilities are opening as human being that we can only now dully intuit. Our potentials for awakening to a Universal Generative and Creative process are largely untapped. I think it's going to blow our freaking minds.
