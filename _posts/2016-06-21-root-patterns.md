What I call our "Root-Pattern" is the fundamental way that we condition our Manifest Reality: the world as it shows up around us, as we participate as the world, and how we show up in the world. To overly simplify one aspect of it, your Root-Pattern may be such that you tend towards introversion or extroversion.   
Our Root-Pattern reflects our ways of habitually orienting our attention (where we focus our attention), and ways of metabolizing energy (what we attend to, and what we tend to ignore.)   
From the perspective of the personality, Our Root-Pattern contains what is unconscious---\> ways in which we condition our Reality that we are not necessarily in alignment with. When we get results, when we live in a world that we are not in alignment with, we are seeing the effects of our Root Pattern. They might be experienced as 'knots' in the free flow of our Creative Being.  
  
From the perspective of our Dreaming, however, even these are elements of our Dreaming. Rather than obstruct or obscure the free flow of our Creative Being, our Root-Pattern is the activity of our Creative Being. We may not consciously choose to show up as we do, and yet we are nevertheless Creating our Life through our Root-Pattern.   
Root-Patterns are intelligent: there's a good reason why you have the shape that you do, whether you think of these reasons as being rational, or as being elements of our Human Dreaming, or as simply being ways that you learned to show up in life to get your needs met. In owning the intelligence of these Patterns, we begin to regain some of the Creativity we feel are locked within them. Trying to remove them or change them only reinforces what we find difficult about them--- and this urge to better, to fix, to change or improve ourselves is something that may itself be embedded deep in the Root-Pattern of your Dreaming.  
  
Your Root-Pattern is also not separable from the Root-Patterns of your environment, especially your social environment. They may seem entirely opposed, but like 'tab A' and 'slot B,' they reflect each other seamlessly. Thus, while we work on our own Root-Patterns, and on making them more and more transparent and liberated, we are working on the Root-Patterns of our social circles, of our society and culture, and of Humanity and the Earth itself.
