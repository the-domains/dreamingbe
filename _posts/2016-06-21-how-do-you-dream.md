# How do you Dream? ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4219cd9992c7fac00cabbaa700dada4b/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3011&cropwidth=1999&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa0aac5d3-fb3a-4362-af2f-6b2c5feb5abf.jpg&x=0&y=0)

Dreaming is a practice of _View_.  
  
Dreaming is a View that takes all of life as Creativity: Life and Being is Unconditioned Creativity. Taking this View, we have experiences that confirm the View and strengthen it, allowing us to relax further into View.  
  
This View includes your Identity, but is not confined to it. So, when you feel like you have a 'knot' in your life, find the intelligence behind it. How has the block actually served you (your Identity)? What Activity of yours can you own that brings this knot into Life?   
All of this manifest world is a result of this Creativity, a Creativity without Identity itself. We take the View that what we are in a bottom line sort of way, is no different than the Creative Force that brings everything about. You can call this whatever you like---whether it's divine, or natural (I have a preference for a 'neither/nor + both/and' interpretation here)---but the point is, what you are emerges from that, and so includes you. And you can relax your own individual identity enough to the point that you recognize this in your own experience.  
  
Working with View then, is the central practice of Dreaming. Or: Dreaming is the only and central practice of Dreaming. You're already doing it. So assume that you are, give that sense attention, awareness, and energy, and see what happens.  
  
But there are other more 'practical' ways of doing this as well, practices that come from Shamanic traditions, Spiritual and Religious lineages, and from modern research into what makes for an effective, happy, and meaningful life.  
  
Of these, the main one is being able to recognize Dreaming, and closely related to this is the ability to sense the presence of Juice, or Creative Energy, in yourself, in your relationship to the world around you, and in the world around you. It's not itself an emotion, a sense, or a feeling, but something like the _intensity_ of emotion, sense, or feeling. I don't mean this as a measure of being _overwhelmed_--- for example, an intense feeling of anger is more likely to take us out of Dreaming than emerge us in it--- but as a way of taking a neutral orientation towards the energy of intense situations, and learning to find that energy in the _flavor_ or _texture _of (any) experience. Using anger as an example, is it possible to experience the energy underlying anger without getting caught up in all of the story and directions of it? Without simply being angry at someone, or because of XYZ reasons---and so trying to justify it--- but just to be aware of the eruption of energy represented by anger?   
I call this non-dual Creativity. What's the Creative impulse underneath the way you see and divide the world up? What includes you as a subject, and the world you live in?   
This is a practice of the flow of life. Where is the flow of life, and what happens if you give attention, awareness, and energy to it? Find that flow, find that life, and enter into it. See what in your environment (you can do this right now) is energizing---when you look at your desk, or your car, or wherever you are, what items or objects around you are exciting? Seem to be calling to you? Seem to be alive themselves? Let yourself be entirely surprised by this.  
  
This is related to what I call "running experiments of the right scope." The central skill here is following energy where it's taking you---as a wholeness of being--- and simply watching what happens when you play with it. Rather than pushing through, say, fear---can you be intensely curious about the experience itself? About the energy of the experience?  
  
This is relevant right now. Are you slogging through this website, or this post? Then stop! Go away! Do something else! This is always relevant.  
  
How are you feeling, right now? Resist the urge to name this experience, and simply follow it with your open and curious attention. Pay attention to the subtle tendencies and impulses of the moment. How does your body want to move? In what direction are you impelled when you just simply stop for a moment?  
  
Actual Creative disciplines are also helpful, or finding what is technically called "Flow," though I use the word a little differently. "Flow" is a good way of finding activities that strengthen your Dreaming, but is usually, and for most of us, context-dependent. "Flow" advocates recommend that you spend as much time in the activities that bring you to Flow as you can---I think this is wise. But Dreaming is an invitation to recognize Dreaming, to recognize the flow of life, in a non-, or cross-contextual way. Can you be Dreaming not just when you're skiing, but when you're washing the dishes? Overly focusing on the positive contexts in which we can already Flow I think can be a distraction from the Activity of Dreaming. Dreaming is not context-dependent.  
  
So get outside of your context! Walk down a different street. Follow the flow of the city (as the situationists practiced.) Stand on a street corner and just wait for something interesting. Sit on a different side of the room---sleep in a different place on your bed, or on your couch. Just try it out! Experiment!  
  
Find Life and Dreaming objects in the world. When I work with people, I often recommend that they find a "Dreaming Totem:" some object in their lives---or that they happen to stumble upon---that stands as a sort of partner in Dreaming, that calls them as a reminder of their Dreaming, that they can see and remember that they are Dreaming.  
  
Risk: nothing enlivens us like taking risks. I don't mean giant, life-changing or threatening risks, I mean experiments of the right scope, where what you'll learn if it doesn't go the way you hope is as valuable as what you're risking. Share with someone that you find them attractive. Tell a friend you're upset that he hasn't reached out in 6 months.  
  
This is all generalized, and is really here to suggest ways of playing around with this yourself, since this, on the ground, will be different for everyone. If you're curious about learning more about Dreaming, entering Dreaming yourself, and how to move forward, get in touch!
