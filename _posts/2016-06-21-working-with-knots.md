# Working with Knots

I use the term 'Knot' to mean a place where our life doesn't flow in the ways that we want it to.  
  
On one side of the knot are our Desires. Part of the work of Dreaming is to uncover in deeper and deeper layers what is true for us, what it is that we Desire. At the heart, we find transpersonal desires: the desire to show up in the world as Love, to Be of service to Life, that all beings may be happy, etc. But even having clarity on our personal needs and desires is helpful: I need an income, I want a life partner that respects me.   
On the other side of the knot are what we believe to be possible--- both about the world, what is real in terms of what we assume about Life in general, and what actions we believe we can take.   
Somewhere between what we Desire and what we Believe to be possible, things have gotten screwed up. That 'screwing up' I call a 'knot,' and as we Dream together, we spend time traversing the many complex strands that have gotten all tangled up---but always with an eye on the fact that really, this is one thread, and at any moment that singularity---the simple connection between what We really, truly want to see in the world, and what we know is potential---pops into place.  
  
Each knot in your life reflects what I call your "Root-Pattern." Your root pattern is the way in which you metabolize energy to create the world around you, and that you've lost touch with the Active nature of. From the perspective of our personality, our root-pattern seems to condition us in ways that limit our creative freedom. From the perspective of Dream-Being, it's merely one particular way in which we condition our reality around us---that is, it's an expression of that Creativity, not a limitation of it. As we relax identity into the activity of the moment to moment, we are re-identifying with the underlying activity that all manifestation is.  
  
Practically, this could look many ways. In a session, we enter into Dreaming in a combination of depth and potential: that is, we want to be in as deep a state as possible, while still not spending a whole two hours on bringing a state of Dreaming about. The _View_ is more important than the state. From here, insight may simply arise, and we'll then pay attention on ways of practically moving that insight into reality. \[See: the right scale of experiment\]. We may work with bodily fields, ways in which different parts of our body hold different energies more easily, which feel 'stuck' and which separate our bodies. We may work on Voice dialogue, reclaiming your ability to speak as eddies in life you feel cut off from.   
But all is in service of the awakening of your Unconditionally Creative Being.
