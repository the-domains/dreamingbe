## "Dreaming includes the visionary, _but anchors it in what is present here_."

In using the word 'Dreaming,' I wish to reclaim an activity of unimaginable power from our modern day use of the term, something dismissive, like "day-dreaming."

Dreaming includes the visionary, _but anchors it in what is present here_. The Visionary is not anywhere 'else.' Dreaming, as I practice it and use the word, is the marriage of the Practical and the Visionary. It is the very real moment-to-moment steps needed to patch up a roof. To mow the lawn. Our Dreaming shows up as the world around us, every environment and every object we live in and which through us lives. Far from simply being "day-dreaming," Dreaming is the activity of every little action in the life we are. 

We tend to bias one of two directions, I've found. Obviously this is more complex than that---each of us evinces a particular arrangement of the following two biases, ways we have them intertwined in our life. We could also call these elements of our Human Dreaming, at least as Modern, Western Humanity. 

We either become more comfortable with the practical, or we become more comfortable with the Visionary. 

We spend more energy and attention either in "Day-dreaming", in picturing possible futures, or in the practical, in handling what needs doing. While these modes seem quite different, they arise out of the same move: separating the possible from the present. 

Why are they so difficult to bring together? 

This points to the difficulties we have with desire and possibility. For Visionaries, those who feel the Reality of what's possible, it can be extremely painful to face what is present, and to be continually let down. Practicals have felt the pain that arises between what happens and what we desire as well, but have shrugged their ability to desire and dream off, figuring they're better off not paying attention to such foolish things. 

This is related to what I call "knots" in our Dreaming, places where what we Desire conflicts with what we feel is Possible. 

In fully rooting both in our capacity to Vision and our capacity to Act, in allowing our Visions to iterate along with what is Actual, and Acting in alignment with the constantly-receding and re-iterating horizon, we are Dreaming, and we are Powerful.
