Dreaming with and coaching people, I've been talking and writing a lot about what I call "The Right Scope of Experiment."   
What is the right scope of experiment? You'll know the right scope when you can answer the question "How might this go wrong?" or "What would failure look like?" with a funny sort of "well jeez there's really no way it _could_ go wrong. It might not work out, exactly, but I'll learn as much as I'm risking."  
  
Another way to approach it is to break what you want to do down into its smallest actions that you might need to take, and start at the very beginning of them. Some might be simple and done without effort, but at some point you're going to find something \[again, an actual, small action\] where you either feel fear or anxiety, or the sense of 'shit, I don't know how to do this.'  
  
If you come up to fear or anxiety, lean back just slightly. Are you focused on the 'big picture,' or the next, practical action that you want to take? If you're focused on the big picture, re-focus on exactly what you need to do next. If you still feel anxious, reframe that feeling as excitement. Physiologically, anxiety and excitement are the same affect--- the only difference is that anxiety is 'down-regulated' excitement. You may not be able to find excitement in the task: 'find a job,' but that's the wrong scale of experiment. Bringing this orientation to an actual practical action, you will be able to find a place where you can lean into the action (say, pick up the phone and call X to catch up and see if he's heard of anything) openly and reframe your anxiety as excitement.  
  
You're doing two things here: as long as you are experimenting with this, running it over and over again, you're training yourself to carry the action itself through effortlessly, without it becoming a block in the flow of your action in the world. You're also simultaneously training yourself to be able to experience the affect of excitement as excitement, without down-regulating it into anxiety. Find where your ability to be open and present with what's in front of you begins to shut down into anxiety, and then _just stay there, and lean in a bit._ \[I'll write some more about this in a few future posts with more specific examples.\]   
__The other thing we do a lot is freeze when we recognize that we need to do _something_ without knowing how to do it. This is really the point of the word _experiment. Life is trust-able._ Life is open, a constant experiment. If you had to know how to do anything before you did it, no human being would ever have learned to do anything. But, we get so used to operating through the safety of what we already know (or believe we do), that we don't realize we built that sense of safety through constant experiment. No, you probably don't know how you'll find a job.  
  
You don't know how you're going to get _anywhere_ before you're there. Maybe you know you're headed to Dallas, but you didn't know that you'd have that specific conversation on the way, that that song would show up on the radio, that you'd stop at that gas station and buy that bottle of water. You didn't know you'd get off an exit early by accident and wind your way to your destination on local roads. _And you can't know that before doing it._ The funny thing is that all the little things that make up the actual experience of the journey are often where we find the most meaning in the journey itself. Traveling to Dallas is a trivial example, but this is equally true for any experiment---how many scientific discoveries that have changed the world were total accidents? \[A whole hell of a lot.\] How many of the little coincidences in life lead you down a whole different path? If you're not open and paying attention to what's actually happening when you run an experiment, you miss out on all of this. So if you 'don't know' how to accomplish a larger goal, break it down into the smaller steps. If you have done that, then find where your energy is getting stuck, and work on leaning into what it is that you're feeling there while reframing it.  
  
And don't forget: it's not an experiment if you're not experimenting: 1) You have to do it enough times to generate enough data. 2) You have to care more about the learning than the result.  
  
1): If you're learning how to reach out to possible contacts and that makes you nervous, lean into the excitement, and reach out to 20 people in one day, or 50\. Not just a handful of people. If nothing works, it's time to re-examine your approach seriously: you're probably at a scope of experiment one or two levels further along than where your actual edge is. If everything works, you'll learn quickly not to avoid this step. If you get mixed results, you'll be learning about what works and what doesn't, and also to let go a little bit of _needing_ it to work. You may get rejected or rebuffed, but you'll get kind replies rather than the 'what was this jerk thinking' that you feared, for example.  
  
2): Again, if you can't answer the question "How might this go wrong?" with a "well, it really can't," you're at the wrong scope of experiment. If you care more about the result than the learning, or if you _need_ the result to happen as you want it to, you're at the wrong scale of experiment.  
  
The basic experiment here is learning how to trust and flow with life. You feel juice, the basic excitement and desire to do something in the world. Send that juice out, and see what comes back. If you run 50 experiments, maybe half of them return some juice, and half don't. But more importantly, you'll get a handful of results that return MUCH more juice than you were expecting, and often in ways that open possibilities you didn't even realize were possible. It's like stumbling on a Shakespearean sonnet when you were looking for letters.  
Have fun!
