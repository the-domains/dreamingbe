# Dreaming Humanity, Dreaming Earth
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c78f98f-4698-471a-967e-7356129bad13.jpg)

Just as we can think of every group that we participate in as having a Dreaming: an intersection between unconditional creative being and the ways the group shows up and behaves, so can we extend this outwards to include all of Humanity: all of our dark and light, the beauty and the tragedy. Inclusive of our history, this present moment, and the possibilities of the future: all of this is encompassed in Dreaming Humanity, and this Dreaming is reflected in each of our Dreaming, and the Dreaming of any relationship we have as humans.  
  
Between our individual Dreaming and Humanity's Dreaming, there are of course many other scopes of Dreaming---an infinite number, far too many to list here. But significantly, there are Masculine and Feminine Dreaming, Culture-based Dreaming at every scale (national, heritage-based, organizational, sub-culture, etc.), Generational Dreaming, Elderly Dreaming and Youth Dreaming. We may tap into any of these, and can find them all reflected in our own Dreaming.  
  
And we are all on the Earth: there is a Dreaming Earth that encompasses all of these, that Includes the animals of the Earth and the plants, the mountains and Oceans, and the Earth itself as a Being.  
  
And it's accessible to us, since we are partaking in it. In conversations, especially when an individual's access to less-encompassing Dreamings is clear (i.e., they are able to manifest as unconditioned creative energy in relation to all of them---at least in the context of a Dreaming Session), then we can 'tap-in' to, or awaken as the Dreaming Earth.   
Similarly we could say that there is a Solar-system Dreaming, a Galaxy Dreaming, a Universe Dreaming. But let's start somewhere ðŸ˜‰
